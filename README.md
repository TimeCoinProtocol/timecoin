# TimeCoinProtocol & dApp Development Activities

## GameTomodachi - Game Player Matchmaking Service
TimeCoinProtcol launch a new project called "GameTomodachi" in May 21st, 2021. "Tomodachi" means a friend in Japanese. GameTomodachi provides game players to find a new game friend to play with/against various games. Not only finding a new game friend, a user can enjoy playing games with influencers such as YouTubers, VTubers, esports professional players, and cute & beautiful girls. While they are playing games online, they can communicate with each other about common interest topics. An influencer can sell a ticket to play a game with a fan, share pictures/video, and sell NFT goods as well.
