TimeCoinProtcol launch a new project called "GameTomodachi" in May 21st, 2021. "Tomodachi" means a friend in Japanese. GameTomodachi provides game players to find a new game friend to play with/against various games. Not only finding a new game friend, a user can enjoy playing games with influencers such as YouTubers, VTubers, esports professional players, and cute & beautiful girls. While they are playing games online, they can communicate with each other about common interest topics. An influencer can sell a ticket to play a game with a fan, share pictures/video, and sell NFT goods as well.

Age: 300 y/o (Self-proclaimed)
He has a cool, sweet voice that can seduce girls.
He used to live as a snake, but after an unexpected encounter in the human world, he was given a human form.
His hair is emerald and shiny, and his skin is covered with scales.
He has an egotistical and bold attitude, but he also has a cute side due to his sweet tooth.
He's usually trying to be cool, but he's really scared of horror games, and tends to scream if he's spooked while playing.
He enjoys playing video games.

### 猫姫にこ / Nekohime Niko
Birthday: Feb. 5
Age: 20 y/o
This girl who has always dreamed of being a cat seems to have made a deal with the Dark Master in order to become a Princess in the cat world.
She is always smiling and makes everyone happy, but she might be hiding something behind that smile...!
When she gets friendly, she tends to say "nyan" (meow) when she's speaking.
She gets nervous when she meets new people, but she has a calm personality and can get along with anyone.
She loves to talk and can't stop once she starts!

### Koizumi Hoshi

Birthday: July 3
Age: Unknown
Hobby: Fulfill wishes
Stuck in her lamp at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, this genie is waiting for a human to discover it. While waiting for someone to discover her lamp, she purchased what she needed on GeniZon to become VTuber, hoping to feel less lonely.  
After learning about the existence of the Internet, she got addicted to video games and vowed to play them just like humans without using magic.
Since she has been living in the Pacific Ocean for a long time, she can speak fluently English and Tagalog. Don't try to ask her how old she is since she lost track of her age.
Let's hope that Hoshi’s lamp won't be found by an evil-minded person.
