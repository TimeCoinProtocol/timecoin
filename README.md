# Timecoin
The TimeCoin token (symbol: TMCN) is an Ethereum-based ERC20 token that supports the functions of the TimeCoin Protocol. 

## TimeCoin Protocol Overview
TimeCoinProtocol (TCP) is a decentralized protocol that allows developers to build and operate decentralized applications (dApps) while also facilitating peer-to-peer trade without the need for intermediaries. It is designed to incentivize cooperation and healthy competition between participants. TCP enables users to carry their reputation with them between services and provides correlative tools that allow operators to actively seek out users who are likely to be interested in their services. 

Freelancers can use dApps built upon TimeCoinProtocol to trade skills, talents, financial assets, products and services, physical and intellectual properties, and transportation. Users seeking these services and assets can easily search for them and purchase directly from the provider via trustless transactions that are facilitated by the underlying blockchain.  

TimeCoinProtocol has been developed by TimeTicket, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Globalway Inc.  Parent company Globalway Inc is an established and trusted market leader in social media with a proven track record in building and operating sharing economy services. TCP is characterized by low transaction fees, efficient utilization of reputational data and activity records which can be shared across dApps, rewards for protocol participants proportionate to their contribution, and minimal development and operational costs.
